## Brief overview
<img src="docs/cellvol_vs_nucvol.png" width="500">
Statistical associations between volumes and areas of cells, nuclei and structures show how strongly these metrics are coupled to each and how they scale with respect to each other. Size scaling analyses and figure creation were implemented in Python 3.7.7. Important numerical, statistical and visualization libraries that were also used include matplotlib 3.3.3, numpy 1.18.5, pandas 1.0.5, scikit-image 0.17.2, scikit-learn 0.23.1, scipy 1.5.0, seaborn 0.10.1, statsmodels 0.11.1.
